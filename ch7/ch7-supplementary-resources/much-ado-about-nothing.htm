    <p class="scenedesc">
      Enter <span class="charname">Leonato, Hero, Beatrice</span> and others,
      with a <span class="charname">Messenger</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night
      to Messina.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      But few of any sort, and none of name.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
      numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a
      young Florentine called Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro.
      He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure
      of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation
      than you must expect of me to tell you how.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much
      joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough
      without a badge of bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Did he break out into tears?
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      In great measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those
      that are so washed; how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at
      weeping!
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      I know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the army
      of any sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      What is he that you ask for, niece?
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      O! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the
      flight; and my uncle&rsquo;s fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for
      Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
      killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? for, indeed,
      I promised to eat all of his killing.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he&rsquo;ll
      be meet with you, I doubt it not.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it; he is a very
      valiant trencher-man; he hath an excellent stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      And a good soldier too, lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all honourable
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      It is so indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the
      stuffing,—well, we are all mortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war
      betwixt Signior Benedick and her; they never meet but there&rsquo;s a
      skirmish of wit between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his
      five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one! so
      that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a
      difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he
      hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He
      hath every month a new sworn brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      Is&rsquo;t possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of
      his hat; it ever changes with the next block.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      No; and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is
      his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with
      him to the devil?
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner
      caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the
      noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand
      pound ere he be cured.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      I will hold friends with you, lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Do, good friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      You will never run mad, niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      No, not till a hot January.
    </p>
    <p>
      MESSENGER.<br />
      Don Pedro is approached.
    </p>
    <p class="scenedesc">
      Enter <span class="charname">Don Pedro, Don John, Claudio, Benedick,
      Balthasar</span> and Others.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble: the
      fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for
      trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me,
      sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is
      your daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Her mother hath many times told me so.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this what you are,
      being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are
      like an honourable father.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on
      her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick:
      nobody marks you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      What! my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food
      to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if
      you come in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all
      ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had
      not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled
      with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your
      humour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear
      he loves me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      God keep your Ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or
      other shall scape a predestinate scratched face.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Scratching could not make it worse, and &rsquo;twere such a face
      as yours were.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a
      continuer. But keep your way, i&rsquo; God&rsquo;s name; I have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      You always end with a jade&rsquo;s trick: I know you of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      That is the sum of all, Leonato: Signior Claudio, and Signior
      Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall
      stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays some occasion may
      detain us longer: I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. [<i>To
      Don John</i>] Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
      the Prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Please it your Grace lead on?
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
    </p>
    <p class="right">
      [<i>Exeunt all but <span class="charname">Benedick</span> and <span
      class="charname">Claudio</span>.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      I noted her not; but I looked on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Is she not a modest young lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple
      true judgment; or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a
      professed tyrant to their sex?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Why, i&rsquo; faith, methinks she&rsquo;s too low for a high
      praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise;
      only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is,
      she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me truly how thou
      likest her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Can the world buy such a jewel?
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad
      brow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good
      hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man
      take you, to go in the song?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter: there&rsquo;s
      her cousin and she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in
      beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have
      no intent to turn husband, have you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn to the contrary,
      if Hero would be my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Is&rsquo;t come to this, in faith? Hath not the world one
      man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor
      of threescore again? Go to, i&rsquo; faith; and thou wilt needs thrust thy
      neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays.

    <p>
      Look! Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to
      Leonato&rsquo;s?
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      I charge thee on thy allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man; I would
      have you think so; but on my allegiance mark you this, on my allegiance:
      he is in love. With who? now that is your Grace&rsquo;s part. Mark how
      short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato&rsquo;s short daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      If this were so, so were it uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Like the old tale, my lord: &lsquo;it is not so, nor
      &rsquo;twas not so; but indeed, God forbid it should be so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      By my troth, I speak my thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      That I love her, I feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      That she is worthy, I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      That I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she
      should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me: I will
      die in it at the stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up,
      I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a recheat
      winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all
      women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust
      any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is,—for the
      which I may go the finer,—I will live a bachelor.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with
      love: prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again
      with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker&rsquo;s pen and hang
      me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a
      notable argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he
      that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Well, as time shall try: &lsquo;In time the savage bull
      doth bear the yoke.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it,
      pluck off the bull&rsquo;s horns and set them in my forehead; and let me
      be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write, &lsquo;Here is
      good horse to hire,&rsquo; let them signify under my sign &lsquo;Here you
      may see Benedick the married man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou
      wilt quake for this shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      I look for an earthquake too then.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime,
      good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato&rsquo;s: commend me to him
      and tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
      great preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so
      I commit you—
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      To the tuition of God: from my house, if I had it,—

      The sixth of July: your loving friend, Benedick.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime
      guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither:
      ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience: and so I
      leave you.

      DON PEDRO.<br />
      My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,<br />

      Any hard lesson that may do thee good.

      No child but Hero; she&rsquo;s his only heir.<br />
      Dost thou affect her, Claudio?

    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      O! my lord,<br />
      When you went onward on this ended action,<br />
      I looked upon her with a soldier&rsquo;s eye,<br />
      That lik&rsquo;d, but had a rougher task in hand<br />
      Than to drive liking to the name of love;<br />
      But now I am return&rsquo;d, and that war-thoughts<br />
      Have left their places vacant, in their rooms<br />
      Come thronging soft and delicate desires,<br />
      All prompting me how fair young Hero is,<br />
      Saying, I lik&rsquo;d her ere I went to wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Thou wilt be like a lover presently,<br />
      And tire the hearer with a book of words.<br />
      If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,<br />
      And I will break with her, and with her father,<br />
      And thou shalt have her. Was&rsquo;t not to this end<br />
      That thou began&rsquo;st to twist so fine a story?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      How sweetly you do minister to love,<br />
      That know love&rsquo;s grief by his complexion!<br />
      But lest my liking might too sudden seem,<br />
      I would have salv&rsquo;d it with a longer treatise.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      What need the bridge much broader than the flood?<br />
      The fairest grant is the necessity.<br />
      Look, what will serve is fit: &rsquo;tis once, thou lov&rsquo;st,<br />
      And I will fit thee with the remedy.<br />
      I know we shall have revelling tonight:<br />
      I will assume thy part in some disguise,<br />
      And tell fair Hero I am Claudio;<br />
      And in her bosom I&rsquo;ll unclasp my heart,<br />
      And take her hearing prisoner with the force<br />
      And strong encounter of my amorous tale:<br />
      Then after to her father will I break;<br />
      And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.<br />
      In practice let us put it presently.

      How now, brother? Where is my cousin your son? Hath he provided
      this music?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTONIO.<br />
      He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange
      news that you yet dreamt not of.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Are they good?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTONIO.<br />
      As the event stamps them: but they have a good cover; they show
      well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached
      alley in my orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the Prince
      discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to
      acknowledge it this night in a dance; and if he found her accordant, he
      meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br /> Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTONIO.<br />
      A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and question him yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself: but I
      will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for
      an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.

    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out of measure sad?
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore the
      sadness is without limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      You should hear reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      And when I have heard it, what blessings brings it?
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      I wonder that thou (being as thou say&rsquo;st thou art, born
      under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying
      mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and
      smile at no man&rsquo;s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no
      man&rsquo;s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man&rsquo;s
      business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      Yea; but you must not make the full show of this till you may do
      it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother,
      and he hath ta&rsquo;en you newly into his grace; where it is impossible
      you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself:
      it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace;
      and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a
      carriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to be a
      flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing
      villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog;
      therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I
      would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking: in the meantime,
      let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br /> Can you make no use of your discontent?

      I came yonder from a great supper: the Prince your brother is

      intended marriage.
    </p>

      DON JOHN.<br />
      A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks he?

      Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.

      A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room,
      comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference: I whipt
      me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should
      woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>

      Come, come; let us thither: this may prove food to my
      displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow: if I

      heart-burned an hour after.

    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      He is of a very melancholy disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      He were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way
      between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image, and says nothing;
      and the other too like my lady&rsquo;s eldest son, evermore tattling.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Then half Signior Benedick&rsquo;s tongue in Count John&rsquo;s
      mouth, and half Count John&rsquo;s melancholy in Signior Benedick&rsquo;s
      face—
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his
      purse, such a man would win any woman in the world if a&rsquo; could get
      her good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou
      be so shrewd of thy tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTONIO.<br />
      In faith, she&rsquo;s too curst.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God&rsquo;s sending
      that way; for it is said, &lsquo;God sends a curst cow short horns;&rsquo;
      but to a cow too curst he sends none.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at
      him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord! I could not endure a
      husband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him
      my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he
      that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is
      not for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him: therefore I
      will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes
      into hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Well then, go you into hell?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      No; but to the gate; and there will the Devil meet me, like an
      old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say, &lsquo;Get you to heaven,
      Beatrice, get you to heaven; here&rsquo;s no place for you maids.&rsquo; So
      deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens: he shows me
      where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.

      [<i>To Hero</i>.] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.

      Yes, faith; it is my cousin&rsquo;s duty to make curtsy,
      and say, &lsquo;Father, as it please you:&rsquo;— but yet for all
      that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another

      BEATRICE.<br />

      The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in
      good time: if the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in
      everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing,
      wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace:
      the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
      fantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest, as a measure, full of state and
      ancientry; and then comes Repentance, and with his bad legs, falls into
      the cinquepace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.

      great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon
      me, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me.
      She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible
      as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to

    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night;
      and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing; but, I warrant
      thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim
      undertake one of Hercules&rsquo; labours, which is, to bring Signior
      Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with
      the other. I would fain have it a match; and I doubt not but to fashion
      it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights&rsquo;
      watchings.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      And I, my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      And you too, gentle Hero?
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus
      far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valour, and
      confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
      shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your two helps, will so
      practise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy
      stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is
      no longer an archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only
      love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

      It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me: I
      am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection
      ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no dishonesty shall
      appear in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      Show me briefly how.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in the
      favour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      I remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to
      look out at her lady&rsquo;s chamber window.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br /> What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the Prince
      your brother; spare not to tell him, that he hath wronged his honour in
      marrying the renowned Claudio,—whose estimation do you mightily hold
      up,—to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      What proof shall I make of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero,
      and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      Only to despite them, I will endeavour anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Go then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count
      Claudio alone: tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind
      of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as—in love of your brother&rsquo;s
      honour, who hath made this match, and his friend&rsquo;s reputation, who
      is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,—that you have
      discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial: offer them
      instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her
      chamber window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio;
      and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding: for
      in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent;
      and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero&rsquo;s disloyalty, that
      jealousy shall be called assurance, and all the preparation overthrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be
      cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.
    </p>
    <p>

      I will presently go learn their day of marriage.

      I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when
      he dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he hath laughed at such
      shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling
      in love: and such a man is Claudio. I have known, when there was no music
      with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor
      and the pipe: I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see
      a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion
      of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an
      honest man and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his words are
      a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so
      converted, and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
      be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I&rsquo;ll take my
      oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such
      a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well;
      another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one
      woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that&rsquo;s certain;
      wise, or I&rsquo;ll none; virtuous, or I&rsquo;ll never cheapen her; fair,
      or I&rsquo;ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not
      I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair
      shall be of what colour it please God. Ha! the Prince and Monsieur Love! I
      will hide me in the arbour.

      No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so

      that I love him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>

      This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for she&rsquo;ll
      be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she
      have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
    </p>

      Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your

    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      O! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found
      Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
    </p>

      CLAUDIO.<br />
      That.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      O! she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at
      herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew
      would flout her: &lsquo;I measure him,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;by my own
      spirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I love him,
      I should.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart,
      tears her hair, prays, curses; &lsquo;O sweet Benedick! God give me
      patience!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      She doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so
      much overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a
      desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.

      It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she
      will not discover it.

      To what end? he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor
      lady worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      And he should, it were an alms to hang him. She&rsquo;s an
      excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.

      O! my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body,
      we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for
      her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      I would she had bestowed this dotage on me; I would have daffed
      all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of
      it, and hear what he will say.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Were it good, think you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die if he
      love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will
      die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed
      crossness.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      She doth well: if she should make tender of her love, &rsquo;tis
      very possible he&rsquo;ll scorn it; for the man,—as you know all,—hath a
      contemptible spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      He is a very proper man.

    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      &rsquo;Fore God, and in my mind, very wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      And I take him to be valiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of quarrels you
      may say he is wise; for either he avoids them with great discretion, or
      undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      If he do fear God, a&rsquo; must necessarily keep peace: if he
      break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it
      seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for
      your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Nay, that&rsquo;s impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool
      the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly
      examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.

      [<i>Aside</i>] Let there be the same net spread for her; and
      that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be,
      when they hold one an opinion of another&rsquo;s dotage, and no such
      matter: that&rsquo;s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a
      dumb show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

      BENEDICK.<br />
      [<i>Advancing from the arbour.</i>] This can be no trick: the
      conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from Hero. They
      seem to pity the lady: it seems her affections have their full bent. Love
      me? why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured: they say I will
      bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too
      that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never
      think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their
      detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair:
      &rsquo;tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: &rsquo;tis so,
      I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no
      addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be
      horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants
      of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but
      doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he
      cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper
      bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the
      world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think
      I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! she&rsquo;s
      a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.

      Good Margaret, run thee to the parlour;<br />
      There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice<br />

      Whisper her ear, and tell her, I and Ursala<br />

      HERO.<br />
      Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,<br />
      As we do trace this alley up and down,<br />
      Our talk must only be of Benedick:<br />
      When I do name him, let it be thy part<br />
      To praise him more than ever man did merit.<br />
      My talk to thee must be how Benedick<br />

      Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
    </p>

      URSULA.<br />
      The pleasant&rsquo;st angling is to see the fish<br />
      Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,<br />
      And greedily devour the treacherous bait:<br />
      So angle we for Beatrice; who even now<br />
      Is couched in the woodbine coverture.<br />
      Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing<br />
      Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
    </p>
    <p class="right">
      [<i>They advance to the bower.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;<br />
      I know her spirits are as coy and wild<br />
      As haggards of the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      URSULA.<br />
      But are you sure<br />
      That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      So says the Prince, and my new-trothed lord.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      URSULA.<br />
      And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;<br />
      But I persuaded them, if they lov&rsquo;d Benedick,<br />
      To wish him wrestle with affection,<br />
      And never to let Beatrice know of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      URSULA.<br />
      Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman<br />
      Deserve as full as fortunate a bed<br />
      As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      O god of love! I know he doth deserve<br />
      As much as may be yielded to a man;<br />
      But Nature never fram&rsquo;d a woman&rsquo;s heart<br />
      Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;<br />
      Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,<br />
      Misprising what they look on, and her wit<br />
      Values itself so highly, that to her<br />
      All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,<br />
      Nor take no shape nor project of affection,<br />
      She is so self-endear&rsquo;d.
    </p>
    <p>
      URSULA.<br />
      Sure I think so;<br />
      And therefore certainly it were not good<br />
      She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,<br />
      How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur&rsquo;d,<br />
      But she would spell him backward: if fair-fac&rsquo;d,<br />
      She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;<br />
      If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antick,<br />
      Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;<br />
      If low, an agate very vilely cut;<br />
      If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;<br />
      If silent, why, a block moved with none.<br />
      So turns she every man the wrong side out,<br />
      And never gives to truth and virtue that<br />
      Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
    </p>
    <p>
      URSULA.<br />
      Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      No; not to be so odd, and from all fashions,<br />
      As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.<br />
      But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,<br />
      She would mock me into air: O! she would laugh me<br />
      Out of myself, press me to death with wit.<br />
      Therefore let Benedick, like cover&rsquo;d fire,<br />
      Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:<br />
      It were a better death than die with mocks,<br />
      Which is as bad as die with tickling.
    </p>
    <p>
      URSULA.<br />
      Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      No; rather I will go to Benedick,<br />
      And counsel him to fight against his passion.<br />
      And, truly, I&rsquo;ll devise some honest slanders<br />
      To stain my cousin with. One doth not know<br />
      How much an ill word may empoison liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      URSULA.<br />
      O! do not do your cousin such a wrong.<br />
      She cannot be so much without true judgment,—<br />
      Having so swift and excellent a wit<br />
      As she is priz&rsquo;d to have,—as to refuse<br />
      So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      He is the only man of Italy,<br />
      Always excepted my dear Claudio.

      I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,<br />
      Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,<br />
      For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,<br />
      Goes foremost in report through Italy.

      Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.

      His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.<br />
      When are you married, madam?

      HERO.<br />
      Why, every day, tomorrow. Come, go in:<br />
      I&rsquo;ll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel<br />
      Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow.

      She&rsquo;s lim&rsquo;d, I warrant you,<br />
      We have caught her, madam.

      Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your

      will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown of
      his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth; he hath twice or thrice
      cut Cupid&rsquo;s bowstring, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him.

      what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.

      Hang him, truant! there&rsquo;s no true drop of blood in him
      to be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money.

      Yet say I, he is in love.
    </p>
    <p>

      There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy
      that he hath to strange disguises; as to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman
      tomorrow; or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the
      waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet.
      Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
      fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old
      signs: a&rsquo; brushes his hat a mornings; what should that bode?

      Hath any man seen him at the barber&rsquo;s?
    </p>
    <p>

      No, but the barber&rsquo;s man hath been seen with him; and the
      old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Nay, a&rsquo; rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      That&rsquo;s as much as to say the sweet youth&rsquo;s in love.

      DON PEDRO.<br />
      The greatest note of it is his melancholy.

      And when was he wont to wash his face?

      Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear what they say of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into a
      lute-string, and now governed by stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude he is in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Nay, but I know who loves him.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.
    </p>

      Yes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for him.

      She shall be buried with her face upwards.

      Yet is this no charm for the tooth-ache. Old signior, walk aside

      Enter <span class="charname">Dogberry</span> and <span class="charname">Verges</span>,
      with the Watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Are you good men and true?
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should
      have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince&rsquo;s watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST WATCH.<br />
      Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal; for they can write and read.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good
      name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of Fortune; but to write and
      read comes by Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND WATCH.<br />
      Both which, Master Constable,—
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour,
      sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing
      and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are
      thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the
      watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall
      comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince&rsquo;s
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND WATCH.<br />
      How, if a&rsquo; will not stand?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently
      call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince&rsquo;s
      subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince&rsquo;s
      subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the
      watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND WATCH.<br />
      We will rather sleep than talk: we know what belongs to a watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I
      cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be
      not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that
      are drunk get them to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND WATCH.<br />
      How if they will not?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Why then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you
      not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND WATCH.<br />
      Well, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your
      office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle
      or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND WATCH.<br />
      If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch
      pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a
      thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who
      hath any honesty in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse
      and bid her still it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND WATCH.<br />
      How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Why then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with
      crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never
      answer a calf when he bleats.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      &rsquo;Tis very true.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      This is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the
      Prince&rsquo;s own person: if you meet the Prince in the night, you may
      stay him.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      Nay, by&rsquo;r lady, that I think, a&rsquo; cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Five shillings to one on&rsquo;t, with any man that knows the
      statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without the Prince be willing; for,
      indeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a
      man against his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      By&rsquo;r lady, I think it be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be any matter of
      weight chances, call up me: keep your fellows&rsquo; counsels and your
      own, and good night. Come, neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND WATCH.<br />
      Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here upon
      the church bench till two, and then all to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you, watch about
      Signior Leonato&rsquo;s door; for the wedding being there tomorrow,
      there is a great coil tonight. Adieu; be vigitant, I beseech
      you.

      I will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy tale.

      Therefore know, I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should
      be so rich; for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may
      make what price they will.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      I wonder at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that the fashion
      of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      Yes, it is apparel.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      I mean, the fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Tush! I may as well say the fool&rsquo;s the fool. But seest
      thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?
    </p>
    <p>
      WATCH.<br />
      [<i>Aside</i>] I know that Deformed; a&rsquo; has been a vile thief
      this seven years; a&rsquo; goes up and down like a gentleman: I remember
      his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Didst thou not hear somebody?
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      No: &rsquo;twas the vane on the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is?
      how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and
      five-and-thirty? sometime fashioning them like Pharaoh&rsquo;s soldiers in
      the reechy painting; sometime like god Bel&rsquo;s priests in the old
      church window; sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched
      worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel
      than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that
      thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Not so neither; but know, that I have tonight wooed Margaret,
      the Lady Hero&rsquo;s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero: she leans me out
      at her mistress&rsquo; chamber window, bids me a thousand times good
      night,—I tell this tale vilely:—I should first tell thee how the Prince,
      Claudio, and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
      John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      And thought they Margaret was Hero?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio; but the devil my
      master, knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first
      possessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but
      chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any slander that Don John had
      made, away went Claudio enraged; swore he would meet her, as he was
      appointed, next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole
      congregation, shame her with what he saw o&rsquo;er night, and send her
      home again without a husband.

      by&rsquo;r Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list; nor I list not
      to think what I can; nor, indeed, I cannot think, if I would think my

      or that you can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he
      become a man: he swore he would never marry; and yet now, in despite of

      Enter <span class="charname">Leonato</span> and <span class="charname">Dogberry</span>
      and <span class="charname">Verges</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      What would you with me, honest neighbour?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you, that decerns
      you nearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Marry, this it is, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      Yes, in truth it is, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      What is it, my good friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter: an old man,
      sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were;
      but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      Yes, I thank God, I am as honest as any man living, that is an old
      man and no honester than I.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Neighbours, you are tedious.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke&rsquo;s
      officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I
      could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      All thy tediousness on me! ah?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Yea, and &rsquo;twere a thousand pound more than &rsquo;tis;
      for I hear as good exclamation on your worship, as of any man in the
      city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      And so am I.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      I would fain know what you have to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your worship&rsquo;s
      presence, ha&rsquo; ta&rsquo;en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in
      Messina.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      A good old man, sir; he will be talking; as they say, &lsquo;when
      the age is in, the wit is out.&rsquo; God help us! it is a world to see!
      Well said, i&rsquo; faith, neighbour Verges: well, God&rsquo;s a good man;
      and two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i&rsquo;
      faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be
      worshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Gifts that God gives.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      I must leave you.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two
      aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before
      your worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Take their examination yourself, and bring it me: I am now in
      great haste, as may appear unto you.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      It shall be suffigance.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.

      Go, good partner, go get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring
      his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we are now to examination these men.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERGES.<br />
      And we must do it wisely.

      We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here&rsquo;s that shall

    <h4><b>SCENE I. The Inside of a Church.</b></h4>
    <p class="scenedesc">
      Enter <span class="charname">Don Pedro, Don John, Leonato, Friar Francis,
      Claudio, Benedick, Hero, Beatrice</span> &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Come, Friar Francis, be brief: only to the plain form of
      marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRIAR.<br />
      You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      To be married to her, friar; you come to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRIAR.<br />
      Lady, you come hither to be married to this Count?
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRIAR.<br />
      If either of you know any inward impediment, why you should not be
      conjoined, I charge you, on your souls, to utter it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Know you any, Hero?
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      None, my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRIAR.<br />
      Know you any, Count?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      I dare make his answer; none.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      O! what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily do, not
      knowing what they do!
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      How now! Interjections? Why then, some be of laughing, as ah!
      ha! he!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Stand thee by, Friar. Father, by your leave:<br />
      Will you with free and unconstrained soul<br />
      Give me this maid, your daughter?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      As freely, son, as God did give her me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      And what have I to give you back whose worth<br />
      May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Nothing, unless you render her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.<br />
      There, Leonato, take her back again:<br />
      Give not this rotten orange to your friend;<br />
      She&rsquo;s but the sign and semblance of her honour.<br />
      Behold! how like a maid she blushes here.<br />
      O! what authority and show of truth<br />
      Can cunning sin cover itself withal.<br />
      Comes not that blood as modest evidence<br />
      To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,<br />
      All you that see her, that she were a maid,<br />
      By these exterior shows? But she is none:<br />
      She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;<br />
      Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      What do you mean, my lord?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Not to be married,<br />
      Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,<br />
      Have vanquish&rsquo;d the resistance of her youth,<br />
      And made defeat of her virginity,—
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      I know what you would say: if I have known her,<br />
      You will say she did embrace me as a husband,<br />
      And so extenuate the forehand sin: No, Leonato,<br />
      I never tempted her with word too large;<br />
      But as a brother to his sister show&rsquo;d<br />
      Bashful sincerity and comely love.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      And seem&rsquo;d I ever otherwise to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:<br />
      You seem to me as Dian in her orb,<br />
      As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;<br />
      But you are more intemperate in your blood<br />
      Than Venus, or those pamper&rsquo;d animals<br />
      That rage in savage sensuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Sweet Prince, why speak not you?
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      What should I speak?<br />
      I stand dishonour&rsquo;d, that have gone about<br />
      To link my dear friend to a common stale.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      This looks not like a nuptial.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      True! O God!
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Leonato, stand I here?<br />
      Is this the Prince? Is this the Prince&rsquo;s brother?<br />
      Is this face Hero&rsquo;s? Are our eyes our own?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      All this is so; but what of this, my lord?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Let me but move one question to your daughter,<br />
      And by that fatherly and kindly power<br />
      That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      O, God defend me! how am I beset!<br />
      What kind of catechizing call you this?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      To make you answer truly to your name.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name<br />
      With any just reproach?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Marry, that can Hero:<br />
      Hero itself can blot out Hero&rsquo;s virtue.<br />
      What man was he talk&rsquo;d with you yesternight<br />
      Out at your window, betwixt twelve and one?<br />
      Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERO.<br />
      I talk&rsquo;d with no man at that hour, my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Why, then are you no maiden.<br />
      Leonato, I am sorry you must hear: upon my honour,<br />
      Myself, my brother, and this grieved Count,<br />
      Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night,<br />
      Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window;<br />
      Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,<br />
      Confess&rsquo;d the vile encounters they have had<br />
      A thousand times in secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON JOHN.<br />
      Fie, fie! they are not to be nam&rsquo;d, my lord,<br />
      Not to be spoke of;<br />
      There is not chastity enough in language<br />
      Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,<br />
      I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou been,<br />
      If half thy outward graces had been plac&rsquo;d<br />
      About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!<br />
      But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,<br />
      Thou pure impiety, and impious purity!<br />
      For thee I&rsquo;ll lock up all the gates of love,<br />
      And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,<br />
      To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,<br />
      And never shall it more be gracious.
    </p>

      A thousand blushing apparitions<br />
      To start into her face; a thousand innocent shames<br />

      And in her eye there hath appear&rsquo;d a fire,<br />
      To burn the errors that these princes hold<br />
      Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;<br />
      Trust not my reading nor my observations,<br />
      Which with experimental seal doth warrant<br />
      The tenure of my book; trust not my age,<br />
      My reverence, calling, nor divinity,<br />

      There is some strange misprision in the princes.

      BENEDICK.<br />
      Two of them have the very bent of honour;<br />
      And if their wisdoms be misled in this,<br />
      The practice of it lives in John the bastard,<br />
      Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      I know not. If they speak but truth of her,<br />
      These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,<br />
      The proudest of them shall well hear of it.<br />
      Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,<br />
      Nor age so eat up my invention,<br />
      Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,<br />
      Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,<br />
      But they shall find, awak&rsquo;d in such a kind,<br />
      Both strength of limb and policy of mind,<br />
      Ability in means and choice of friends,<br />
      To quit me of them throughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRIAR.<br />
      Pause awhile,<br />
      And let my counsel sway you in this case.<br />
      Your daughter here the princes left for dead;<br />
      Let her awhile be secretly kept in,<br />
      And publish it that she is dead indeed:<br />
      Maintain a mourning ostentation;<br />

      LEONATO.<br />
      What shall become of this? What will this do?
    </p>
    <p>
      FRIAR.<br />
      Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf<br />
      Change slander to remorse; that is some good.<br />
      But not for that dream I on this strange course,<br />
      But on this travail look for greater birth.<br />
      She dying, as it must be so maintain&rsquo;d,<br />
      Upon the instant that she was accus&rsquo;d,<br />
      Shall be lamented, pitied and excus&rsquo;d<br />
      Of every hearer; for it so falls out<br />
      That what we have we prize not to the worth<br />
      Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack&rsquo;d and lost,<br />
      Why, then we rack the value, then we find<br />
      The virtue that possession would not show us<br />
      Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:<br />
      When he shall hear she died upon his words,<br />
      The idea of her life shall sweetly creep<br />
      Into his study of imagination,<br />
      And every lovely organ of her life<br />
      Shall come apparell&rsquo;d in more precious habit,<br />
      More moving, delicate, and full of life<br />
      Into the eye and prospect of his soul,<br />
      Than when she liv&rsquo;d indeed: then shall he mourn,—<br />
      If ever love had interest in his liver,—<br />
      And wish he had not so accused her,<br />
      No, though he thought his accusation true.<br />
      Let this be so, and doubt not but success<br />
      Will fashion the event in better shape<br />
      Than I can lay it down in likelihood.<br />
      But if all aim but this be levell&rsquo;d false,<br />
      The supposition of the lady&rsquo;s death<br />
      Will quench the wonder of her infamy:<br />
      And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,—<br />
      As best befits her wounded reputation,—<br />
      In some reclusive and religious life,<br />
      Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:<br />
      And though you know my inwardness and love<br />
      Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio,<br />
      Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this<br />
      As secretly and justly as your soul<br />
      Should with your body.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONATO.<br />
      Being that I flow in grief,<br />
      The smallest twine may lead me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRIAR.<br />
      &rsquo;Tis well consented: presently away;<br />
      For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.<br />
      Come, lady, die to live: this wedding day<br />
      Perhaps is but prolong&rsquo;d: have patience and endure.<br />

      BENEDICK.<br />
      Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      I will not desire that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      You have no reason; I do it freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Ah! how much might the man deserve of me that would right her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Is there any way to show such friendship?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      A very even way, but no such friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      May a man do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      It is a man&rsquo;s office, but not yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is not that strange?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for
      me to say I loved nothing so well as you; but believe me not, and yet
      I lie not; I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my
      cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Do not swear by it, and eat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make him eat it
      that says I love not you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Will you not eat your word?
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Why then, God forgive me!
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      What offence, sweet Beatrice?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to protest I loved you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      And do it with all thy heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Come, bid me do anything for thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Kill Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Ha! not for the wide world.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in you: nay, I
      pray you, let me go.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Beatrice,—
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      In faith, I will go.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      We&rsquo;ll be friends first.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Is Claudio thine enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered,
      scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O! that I were a man. What! bear her in
      hand until they come to take hands, and then, with public accusation,
      uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,—O God, that I were a man! I would
      eat his heart in the market-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Hear me, Beatrice,—
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Talk with a man out at a window! a proper saying!
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Nay, but Beatrice,—
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Sweet Hero! she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Beat—
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Princes and Counties! Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly
      Count Comfect; a sweet gallant, surely! O! that I were a man for his sake,
      or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted
      into curtsies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue,
      and trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie
      and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a
      woman with grieving.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Yea, as sure is I have a thought or a soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Enough! I am engaged, I will challenge him. I will kiss your
      hand, and so leave you. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear
      account. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your cousin: I
      must say she is dead; and so, farewell.

      Nay, that&rsquo;s certain: we have the exhibition to examine.

      Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your name, friend?

    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah?

      I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.

      Write down Master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve God?
    </p>
    <p>
      BOTH.<br />
      Yea, sir, we hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Write down that they hope they serve God: and write God first;
      for God defend but God should go before such villains! Masters, it is
      proved already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will
      go near to be thought so shortly. How answer you for yourselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      CONRADE.<br />
      Marry, sir, we say we are none.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go
      about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir, I
      say to you, it is thought you are false knaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORACHIO.<br />
      Sir, I say to you we are none.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Well, stand aside. Fore God, they are both in a tale. Have you
      writ down, that they are none?
    </p>
    <p>
      SEXTON.<br />
      Master Constable, you go not the way to examine: you must call
      forth the watch that are their accusers.

      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Yea, marry, that&rsquo;s the eftest way. Let the watch come forth.

    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST WATCH.<br />
      This man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince&rsquo;s
      brother, was a villain.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury, to
      call a Prince&rsquo;s brother villain.

      What heard you him say else?

      Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John
      for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.

      And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to disgrace
      Hero before the whole assembly, and not marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGBERRY.<br />
      O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption
      for this.

      SEXTON.<br />
      What else?

    <p>
      SECOND WATCH.<br />
      This is all.
    </p>
    <p>
      SEXTON.<br />
      And this is more, masters, than you can deny. Prince John is this
      morning secretly stolen away: Hero was in this manner accused, in this
      manner refused, and, upon the grief of this, suddenly died. Master
      Constable, let these men be bound, and brought to Leonato&rsquo;s: I will

      No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by

      I pray thee, cease thy counsel,<br />
      Which falls into mine ears as profitless<br />
      As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;<br />
      Nor let no comforter delight mine ear<br />
      But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine:<br />
      Bring me a father that so lov&rsquo;d his child,<br />
      Whose joy of her is overwhelm&rsquo;d like mine,<br />
      And bid him speak of patience;<br />
      Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,<br />
      And let it answer every strain for strain,<br />
      As thus for thus and such a grief for such,<br />

      If such a one will smile, and stroke his beard;<br />
      Bid sorrow wag, cry &lsquo;hem&rsquo; when he should groan,<br />
      Patch grief with proverbs; make misfortune drunk<br />
      With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,<br />
      And I of him will gather patience.<br />
      But there is no such man; for, brother, men<br />
      Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief<br />
      Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,<br />
      Their counsel turns to passion, which before<br />
      Would give preceptial medicine to rage,<br />
      Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,<br />
      Charm ache with air and agony with words.<br />
      No, no; &rsquo;tis all men&rsquo;s office to speak patience<br />
      To those that wring under the load of sorrow,<br />
      But no man&rsquo;s virtue nor sufficiency<br />

      As, under privilege of age, to brag<br />
      What I have done being young, or what would do,<br />
      Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,<br />
      Thou hast so wrong&rsquo;d mine innocent child and me<br />
      That I am forc&rsquo;d to lay my reverence by,<br />
      And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,<br />
      Do challenge thee to trial of a man.<br />
      I say thou hast belied mine innocent child:<br />
      Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,<br />

      Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill&rsquo;d my child;<br />

      He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:<br />

      Win me and wear me; let him answer me.<br />
      Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me.<br />
      Sir boy, I&rsquo;ll whip you from your foining fence;<br />
      Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.

      Good day, my lord.

      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part almost a fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old
      men without teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Leonato and his brother. What think&rsquo;st thou? Had we
      fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek you both.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof
      melancholy, and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      It is in my scabbard; shall I draw it?
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Never any did so, though very many have been beside their wit. I
      will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.

      As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or angry?
    </p>

      What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat, thou hast
      mettle enough in thee to kill care.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you charge it
      against me. I pray you choose another subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      Nay then, give him another staff: this last was broke cross.

      By this light, he changes more and more: I think he be angry indeed.

      [<i>Aside to Claudio.</i>] You are a villain, I jest not: I will
      make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me
      right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and
      her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you.

      naught. Shall I not find a woodcock too?

      Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      I&rsquo;ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
      other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit. &lsquo;True,&rsquo; says
      she, &lsquo;a fine little one.&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I,
      &lsquo;a great wit.&rsquo; &lsquo;Right,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;a
      great gross one.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;a good wit.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Just,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;it hurts nobody.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo;
      said I, &lsquo;the gentleman is wise.&rsquo; &lsquo;Certain,&rsquo;
      said she, &lsquo;a wise gentleman.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said I,
      &lsquo;he hath the tongues.&rsquo; &lsquo;That I believe&rsquo; said
      she, &lsquo;for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he
      forswore on Tuesday morning: there&rsquo;s a double tongue; there&rsquo;s
      two tongues.&rsquo; Thus did she, an hour together, trans-shape thy
      particular virtues; yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast
      the properest man in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON PEDRO.<br />
      Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not
      hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man&rsquo;s daughter
      told us all.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLAUDIO.<br />
      All, all; and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.
    </p>

      But when shall we set the savage bull&rsquo;s horns on the
      sensible Benedick&rsquo;s head?
    </p>

      Yea, and text underneath, &lsquo;Here dwells Benedick the

    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave you now to
      your gossip-like humour; you break jests as braggarts do their blades,
      which, God be thanked, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
      you: I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled
      from Messina: you have, among you, killed a sweet and innocent lady. For
      my Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet; and till then, peace be
      with him.

      Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they
      have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly,
      they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to
      conclude, they are lying knaves.

      First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what&rsquo;s

      what you lay to their charge?

      Sweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer: do you hear
      me, and let this Count kill me. I have deceived even your very eyes: what
      your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to
      light; who, in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John
      your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought
      into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero&rsquo;s garments; how
      you disgraced her, when you should marry her. My villainy they have upon
      record; which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my
      shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master&rsquo;s false accusation;
      and, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.

      one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it,
      and borrows money in God&rsquo;s name, the which he hath used so long and

      Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by
      helping me to the speech of Beatrice.

    <p>
      MARGARET.<br />
      Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over
      it; for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARGARET.<br />
      To have no man come over me! why, shall I always keep below stairs?
    </p>

      BENEDICK.<br />
      Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound&rsquo;s mouth; it catches.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARGARET.<br />
      And yours as blunt as the fencer&rsquo;s foils, which hit, but hurt not.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a woman: and so, I
      pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARGARET.<br />
      Give us the swords, we have bucklers of our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a
      vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.

      Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.

      O, stay but till then!

      &lsquo;Then&rsquo; is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere I
      go, let me go with that I came for; which is, with knowing what hath
      passed between you and Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath,
      and foul breath is noisome; therefore I will depart unkissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible
      is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge,
      and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward.
      And, I pray thee now, tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first
      fall in love with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      For them all together; which maintained so politic a state
      of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with
      them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      &lsquo;Suffer love,&rsquo; a good epithet! I do suffer love
      indeed, for I love thee against my will.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you spite
      it for my sake, I will spite it for yours; for I will never love that
      which my friend hates.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br />
      It appears not in this confession: there&rsquo;s not one wise
      man among twenty that will praise himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of
      good neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he
      dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
      widow weeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      BEATRICE.<br /> And how long is that think you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICK.<br />
      Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum:
      therefore is it most expedient for the wise,—if Don Worm, his conscience,
      find no impediment to the contrary,—to be the trumpet of his own virtues,
      as I am to myself. So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear
      witness, is praiseworthy. And now tell me, how doth your cousin?

Produced by The PG Shakespeare Team, a team of about twenty Project
Gutenberg volunteers

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
